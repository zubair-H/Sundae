Every document in Cloud Firestore is uniquely identified by its location within the database.
The previous example showed a document alovelace within the collection users.
To refer to this location in your code, you can create a reference to it.

    import { doc } from "firebase/firestore";
    const alovelaceDocumentRef = doc(db, 'users', 'alovelace');
                    OR for convenience
    const alovelaceDocumentRef = doc(db, 'users/alovelace');

Same thing for collections

    import { collection } from "firebase/firestore";
    const usersCollectionRef = collection(db, 'users');
